# lit-glsl

`lit-glsl` provides a javascript literal function, that allows writing glsl code within your javascript/typescript file.

## Install

```
yarn install @rammbulanz/lit-glsl
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { glsl } from '@rammbulanz/lit-glsl'

/**
 * `vertexShader` will contain the shader as string.
 * There isn't any precompile action for now.
 */
const vertexShader = glsl`
	precision highp float;
	attribute vec3 position;
	uniform mat4 worldViewProjection;
	void main() {
		gl_Position = worldViewProjection * vec4(position, 1.0);
	}
`;

// Same logic for fragment shader

```
